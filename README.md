- This is a simple client side *Restaurant Management Website* where you can add food name, details, image, quantity , price and many more. You can *add or edit* your foods anytime. You can view the food details by clicking details button. You can order food that is added by others that will reduce the total quantity of food and cancel them anytime. A gallery page is built where one can see a collection of food images, and clicking them will make them bigger in screen.
- However, some of the routes are private, you have to register or log in for that. Backend is based on Node JS, Mongo DB, express JS. **Firebase** is used for user authentication and JWT Token.
